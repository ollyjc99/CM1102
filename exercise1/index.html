    <p>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was a computer scientist born on the 9<sup>th</sup> of September, 1941 in Bronxville, New York, U.S.
    Mr. Ritchie has had a large influence over the entire Computing industry all over the world. Ritchie attended Harvard Univeristy
    and graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics. Ritchie gained a large interest in how computers were programmed.
    Mr. Ritchie eventually decided that he wanted to pursue a career in computing rather than physics by the time he graduated.<p/>

    <p>Dennis Ritchie would end up working alongside his co-worker, Kenneth Thompson, who had joined the Bell Labs with Ritchie. Both
    Ritchie and Thompson would create UNIX, an operating system that allowed users to copy delete, edit and print files. One of the main
    advantages of UNIX was that it was cheap and simple to use. UNIX could be considered revolutionary at the time because the operating system was compatible
    with most software.</p>

    <p>Dennis Ritchie is also known as the father of the C programming language. The UNIX operating system needed a programming language
    to operate, so Mr. Ritchie combined some parts from previously known computer systems with his new idea. It was a very simple language
    to learn so it took little convincing for coders to switch over. The C programming language eventually became one of the most popular
  programming languages in the world.</p>
