      <p>Dennis Ritchie is a very important and widely known figure in Computer Science. This is because of his profound work in computing languages and operating
        systems. However he is probably most well known for creating the C programming language and UNIX.</p>

        </a>Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language for the UNIX programming. The language was based off of previous computer systems which Dennis Ritchie had studied,
        combined with the new system he was designing. The language was, and still is, simple and easy to learn. It features a variety of built in modules which can be easily implemented.
        C uses very few syntax and instructions. C programming language is still one of the more dominant programming languages used today. Dennis Ritchie also wrote the book <cite> The C Programming Language</cite> with Brian W. Kernighan.</dd>

        <dd>Dennis Ritchie is widely known as the father of Unix. Mr. Ritchie created the UNIX operating system alongside Ken Thompson, and in the process developed the C programming language based off of pre-existing systems. </dd>
