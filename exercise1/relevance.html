      <p> Dennis Ritchie's work still has relevancy till this day because his work is still widely used. The C programming language laid the building blocks for almost all programming in the computing industry. He is widely recognised for his instrumental role in the development of Unix
      He arguably helped to shape a new digital era. So much of the current modern world is built off of Ritchie and Thompson's work with UNIX. Dennis Ritchie's death in 2011 was largely overshadowed by Steve Jobs, mainly because Stebe Jobs was more of a celebrity and house hold name than Ritchie. Nevertheless Mr. Ritchie's work arguably influenced Steve Job's Apple and his work can be seen amongst computers in the modern day.</p>
      <p>The UNIX operating system allowed users to create, edit and delete files. UNIX was also cheap and simple to use. UNIX was also very innovative because at tht time the operating system was compatible with most computing software. The development of UNIX mean't that access to system computers became available to everyone. The C language is currently used worldwide in computing. With UNIX also playing an essential part in influencing future systems.
      Dennis Ritchie himself sees Linux as a continuation of he and Ken Thompson's initial ideas and foundations.</p>
